Note:
If you don't have the g++ compiler you should 
download the MinGW C++ compiler from here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/ ,
it contains the g++
then add it in the environmnet variables -> system variables
scroll for Path then double click it and click New
then write C:\MinGW\bin then press OK in all open windows to save the
changes, have fun!

# Area-Calculator

+ In the program directory, open the cmd

# Compile it using 
- g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
# Run it using
- main.exe (windows)
- ./main (linux)

I pushed also the main.exe so you can run it directly but it's not guaranteed if you haven't the compiler, Thank you.
